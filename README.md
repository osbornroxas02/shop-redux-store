## Description 

This Shop Redux Store projects goal was to refactor the e-commerce platform from the previous module project so that it uses Redux. 

---

## Assignment Goal

GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state

WHEN I review the appâ€™s store

THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API

WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store

THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider

WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state

THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API

WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store

THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API

WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions

THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
